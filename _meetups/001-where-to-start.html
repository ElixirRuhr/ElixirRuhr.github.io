            René started with BASIC at the age of 10 and has been employed as a coder since the age of 17. By now he has 10 years of Ruby and roughly 2 years of Elixir experience. According to unconfirmed sources, he describes himself as an "open source aficionado". He is the creator of

            Constantin creates software for over 20 years. In 2014, he stumbled upon
            Elixir and was immediately captivated. If time permits he
            contributes to various open source projects, for example his
            well-known <a href="https://github.com/c-rack/quantum-elixir">Quantum
            library</a>, a cron-like job scheduler for Elixir.
